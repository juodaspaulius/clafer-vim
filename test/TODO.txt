For now just a few ideas what to test (if we ever decide to test things)

T1. How does this behave when starting in compatible mode (does it?) Any other
relevant modes/switches to try? Actually we have a case of a highly
configurable system testing :)



I start my vim testing environemnt with: vim -u ~/.vimrc-test
